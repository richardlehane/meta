The Meta package:

  - defines NSW State Archives approach to the construction of SIPS in the [OAIS model](https://www.oclc.org/research/publications/library/2000/lavoie-oais.html).
  - defines schemas for the metadata.json, manifest.json and json log files within these SIPS
  - is a software library that can be used by scripts in order to generate these SIPS.
