# Meta

The Meta package:

  - defines NSW State Archives approach to the construction of SIPS in the [OAIS model](https://www.oclc.org/research/publications/library/2000/lavoie-oais.html).
  - defines schemas for the metadata.json, manifest.json and json log files within these SIPS
  - is a software library that can be used by scripts in order to generate these SIPS
  - contains a set of generic metadata loaders and actions that can be used across projects
  - contains Meta cmd, a command line tool that demonstrates the generic loaders and can be used for very simple projects.

See the docs folder for more detail about the Digital State Archive storage and manifest file specifications.
